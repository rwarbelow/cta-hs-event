### Intro

* Staff + TA Intros
* What is coding?
* What can you do with code? 

### Setup

1) Sign up for GH account and verify email address
2) Make a GH repo called username.github.io with a README (don't forget this part!)
3) Add a new file `index.html` with "Hello, World!" inside (no HTML). 
4) Click on "Settings" and scroll to GH pages. Select "Master" and click "Save". 
5) Refresh the page until the link turns green, then click on it. Tada! This is a link you can share with your family, and we'll build out the rest of the page today. 

### Creating a Header with Codepen 

1) In another tab, go to codepen.io and click "Create" in upper right-hand corner and select "New Pen". Explain to students that Codepen will be our "draft" area where we figure out what looks good, then once we have it, we'll add it over in Github.
2) Type `doc-tab` in HTML which will generate the basic HTML: this bit of code that will tell our browser (Chrome/Firefox) that we are writing an HTML document in addition to creating the spaces for us to write our code. 
3) Ask students: What do you notice about the code here? angle brackets, opening and closing tags, etc.
4) Look at <body> tag: this is where we will put all of the content for our website.
5) Have students type header-tab: this will generate an element that we can style. Think of it as an invisible box until we give it some color and size. 
6) Go to CSS tab and add background and height properties to the div to make it into a nav bar. Give students time to find a height and a background that they like.
7) Inside of the header, have students type h1-tab. Inside of the h1 tags, students should write their first and last names.
8) Add an h1 rule in the CSS and add a font-family, color, and text-align property.
9) Have students choose their body background color in CSS. 

### Creating an About Me

1) Have students type main-tab underneath their closing header tag.
2) Inside of main, have students create another header, between h1 and h6, for "About Me."
3) Show students how to add an image. If they have an image of themselves on the internet, they can find it, isolate it, and grab the source. If not, they can grab a photo of something that represents themselves on Google images.
4) Show students how to choose height, border, and float for image in CSS. 
3) Under the header but still inside main, have students create a paragraph tag and add 3-5 sentences about themselves.
4) Have students add a height for main and a border-bottom.

### Creating a Skills section

1) Show students to type section-tab. 
2) Inside of the section, add another heading for "Skills"
3) Show students how to generate an ordered list (ol-tab). 
4) Inside of the ol, have students type li-tab and then add skills within the brackets.

### Adding Links (if time permits)

1) a-tab to create a link. Show students how to add user-facing text and how to add link address. Emphasize that the link address needs to be the WHOLE address. 
2) Style the link using the color property. 
3) Style hovering over the link using the `hover` pseudoclass. 

### Shipping Code

1) Don't forget to have students add a `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">` to the head of their HTML doc.
2) Have students go back to GH and click the edit button of their index file. Delete Hello World.
3) Go back to codepen and copy all html. Paste it into the file and click save. 
4) Add a new file called style.css and paste in all CSS from codepen. Click save. 
5) Save and refresh username.github.io.
